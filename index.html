            I made this site for everyone who wants to go back in time and play games that all of us know.
            All games can be played by 1 person, but you can also play with friends for more fun.

                            Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.<br>
                            2. The first player to get 3 marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally)
                            is the winner.<br>
                            3. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks
                            in a row, the game ends in a tie..</p>

                            You have to figure out the word by guessing letters.
                            If you want you can click on the hint button and get a clue for the word.
                            If you guess 10 letters
                            which do not appear in the word,
