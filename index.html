              1. You are X, your friend (or the computer) is O. Players take
              turns putting their marks in empty squares.
              <br />
              2. The first player to get 3 marks in a row (up, down, across, or
              diagonally) is the winner.
              <br />
              3. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has
              3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie..

              There are three possible hand signals that represent a rock,
              paper, and scissors.
              <br />
              Rock wins against scissors,
              <br />
              paper wins against rock,
              <br />
              and scissors wins against paper.
              <br />
              If both players throw the same hand signal, it is considered a
              tie.

              Every game has chosen random category and word in the category.
              You have to figure out the word by guessing letters. If you want
              you can click on the hint button and get a clue for the word. If
              you guess 10 letters which do not appear in the word, you are
              hanged.
